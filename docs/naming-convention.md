When working with React, following naming conventions helps maintain readability and consistency in your codebase. Here are some common conventions to consider:

### 1. **Component Names**
- **PascalCase**: Component names should be written in PascalCase. For example:
  ```jsx
  function MyComponent() { ... }
  ```

### 2. **File Names**
- **KebabCase**: File names for components should match the component name and be in KebabCase.
  ```
  my-component.js
  ```

### 3. **Props and State**
- **camelCase**: Use camelCase for prop names and state variables.
  ```jsx
  &amp;lt;MyComponent myProp={value} /&amp;gt;
  ```

### 4. **Event Handlers**
- **handle[EventName]**: Prefix event handler functions with &amp;quot;handle&amp;quot; followed by the event name.
  ```jsx
  function handleClick() { ... }
  ```

### 5. **Constants**
- **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE**: Use uppercase letters with underscores for constants.
  ```jsx
  const MAX_LENGTH = 100;
  ```

### 6. **CSS Class Names**
- **BEM Convention or camelCase**: Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) or camelCase for CSS class names.
  ```css
  .myComponent__button--active { ... }
  ```

### 7. **Hooks**
- **use[Feature]**: Custom hooks should start with &amp;quot;use&amp;quot;.
  ```jsx
  function useFetchData() { ... }
  ```

### 8. **Context and Reducer Names**
- **PascalCase**: Context and reducer files should also follow PascalCase.
  ```jsx
  const MyContext = createContext();
  ```

### 9. **Folder Structure**
- Keep a consistent folder structure. For example:
  ```
  /components
    - my-component/
      - my-component.js
      - my-component.css
  ```

### 10. **Isolated Tests**
- If you have tests, place them alongside the component or in a separate `__tests__```plaintext
  ` folder.
```
- For example:
```
/components
- my-component/
    - __tests__/
      - my-component.test.js
    - my-component.js
    - my-component.css
```

### Summary
Following these conventions helps improve code maintainability and readability, making it easier for you and others to understand your project. Consistency in naming throughout the codebase is key to effective collaboration and development in React.
